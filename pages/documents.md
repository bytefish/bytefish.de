              The kind of guide I have wished for, when I was working myself into face recognition. Helps 
              you with installing OpenCV2 and building projects on Windows and Linux. The Eigenfaces and 
              Fisherfaces method are explained and implemented with Python, GNU Octave/MATLAB and 
              OpenCV&#039;s C++ <acronym title="Application Programming Interface">API</acronym>.

              Is an introduction into statistical machine learning with OpenCV. It contains a 
              guide for setting up OpenCV on Windows and Linux. A brief introduction and code 
              for Support Vector Machines and Multilayer Perceptrons is given. Good to get 
              started with OpenCV and its Machine Learning library!
