## 2025-06-21: Starting with flink-jam ##

So... Another week went by, but I finally had some time to look into my project idea. 

First of all I gave it the catchy name `flink-jam`. In the past week I have read some articles on 
my smartphone on how to import OSM data and query it. Today I was allowed to sit in front of the 
screen, and I was able to download and import the OSM data. 

It wasn't as smooth as I had expected. The initial queries had been super slow and importing the OSM 
data initially led to problems with the Docker volumes. Then a query was missing and the queries on 
my data have been extremly slow. 

But after some playing around with the query planner and indices, I got it to work just fine.

The next round is going to be with Java.

## 2025-06-14: Formulation a Project Idea ##

I think I have come up with an idea to play around with. ü•π I‚Äôll call it ‚ÄúTraffic Congestion Detection‚Äù for lack of a cool name.

The idea is to first import OSM data to Postgres. This should be painless, I‚Äôll download the data from Geofabrik and import it to Postgres. I am going to use the Postgres EDB installer to automatically add the Postgis extension. 

Then in Postgres I‚Äôll extract the Road Segments and assign them speed limits. I guess you need to use some kind of Road Segment to group traffic of multiple vehicles. In another table I am going to store Traffic Light Positions, because we expect congestion at Traffic Lights, right?

A small Python (not sure yet?) script is used to generate various traffic patterns within positions in a specific area in Germany. This will also give me the possibility to load test the application.

I could then use Apache Flink to detect various pattern in traffic like ‚ÄúLight Congestion‚Äù, ‚ÄúSevere Congestion‚Äù, ‚ÄúTraffic Jam‚Äù. The interesting thing here is, that we could use the CEP with different windows and see how it works.

In a later installment I am going to revive my ‚ÄúOpenSky Flight Tracker‚Äù project to also visualize traffic (or at least draw circles around alarms). I have to see, H√∂ complicated coloring road segments are. But the possibilities with this experiment are endless!

However, the week ahead is again filled with family things to do. So there is no leisure time left for my ‚Äúvery important side projects‚Äù. 

## 2025-06-14: Keep on writing  ##

So‚Ä¶ After the initial high of free-form writing, things slowed down, while I am working full-time. The weekend is going to be filled with gardening, keeping the children busy and sleeping.

There‚Äôs not much programming to be expected. And I didn‚Äôt come up with a 1-day side project idea yet, which could be done within some hours. It‚Äôs just not feasible to start larger projects right now, because there‚Äôs no time left.

Anyways, let‚Äôs keep on writing!

## 2025-06-09: How Ideas for Projects Come to Life  ##

I am wondering, what project I could do next, so let's see my thought process.

Something I always wanted to get my hands on again is Apache Flink and its CEP Engine. From time to time I browse through my article and wonder... how could I revive it?

The Apache Flink example is in the following repository:

* [https://github.com/bytefish/FlinkExperiments](https://github.com/bytefish/FlinkExperiments)

Last year I have played around with NATS and JetStream to understand how their JetStream engine works and how a distributed system could be built... without the hellhole Kafka is. 

There's a GitHub repository I used to experiment with NATS in .NET here:

* [https://github.com/bytefish/NatsExperiments](https://github.com/bytefish/NatsExperiments)

The GitHub Repository comes with a Docker Compose file, so getting a NATS Cluster up and running *should* be possible relatively quick. 

The Synadia folks, that maintain the NATS ecosystem, also provide a NATS Connector at:

* [https://github.com/synadia-io/flink-connector-nats](https://github.com/synadia-io/flink-connector-nats)

So it shouldn't require a lot of infrastructure code to connect NATS an Apache Flink. We can find a few examples in the Synadia repository with sample code to get some inspiration from.

But where do we get the data to stream from?

See I have previously written an article for analyzing the German weather data to detect heat strikes, where there was severe heat in Germany for consecutive days:

* [https://github.com/bytefish/DwdAnalysis](https://github.com/bytefish/DwdAnalysis)

It would be cool to reuse it and see if I can reproduce the findings with Apache Flink. But the example repository is based on SQL Server, and SQL Server has a super complicated license. 

In order to have an example, that people could download and get it up and running, I would need to rewrite this to PostgreSQL. This would also require to port the parsing to Java, because I don't want .NET and Java mixed. 

The simplest approach for parsing the CSV is to use JTinyCsvParser:

* [https://github.com/bytefish/JTinyCsvParser](https://github.com/bytefish/JTinyCsvParser)

While at it, it's probably useful to update it to Java 24, too? I could then bulk import everything into PostgreSQL using something like this:

* [https://www.bytefish.de/blog/bulk_updates_postgres.html](https://www.bytefish.de/blog/bulk_updates_postgres.html)

Or I could dogfood and use PgBulkInsert, which would open yet another front, where I could find things to do, instead of concentrating on Apache Flink. But if I use Postgres without PgBulkInsert, then how do I use Composite Types?

All in all, this idea is canceled for now, because it's not something to write up within a day. It's an overly ambitious project, that takes weeks to finish, and only if I get a few hours on the weekends.


## 2025-06-08: Shifting Priorities and Programming ##

It‚Äôs Pentecost, so Germany has a long weekend. Back when I didn‚Äôt have a family, these days would have been filled with working myself into things. And most importantly: I would have used the time to program something for *myself*, instead of *writing code for a company*.

But ever since having a wife and children things surprisingly changed. Of course priorities shift, and instead of learning all about, say ‚ÄúGraph Databases‚Äù, my free time is spent with family things. I am waiting for weeks to find some quiet hours to try ideas accumulated inside.

By now I do most of my writing and reading on a smartphone. The latest article on Google Zanzibar is no different, the code has been written in the Notes app on the phone. Auto-correct is the enemy!

Once I could hide inside my office, I boot a computer (thanks to modern hard drives it doesn‚Äôt take a lot of time!). I am copying the code, correct all the syntax errors and draft an article in parallel.

I wonder how other people handle it?

## 2025-06-07: How it all started... 22 years ago  ##

This page started in 2003 as a way to share my poems with the world. It was a time full of beautiful self-pity, and not knowing what to do with my life‚Ä¶ basically the whole range of first-world problems.

Please never use the Wayback Machine!

To the next 20 years to come!üçª

## 2025-06-07: The Microsoft Copilot Distortion Bubble ##

The Microsoft Build 2025 conference was all about AI and how it improves productivity. So it‚Äôs interesting to see Microsoft dogfooding Copilot in their `dotnet/aspnetcore` and `dotnet/runtime` repositories:

* [https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pulls](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pulls)

It‚Äôs hilarious to see these world class engineers begging their Copilot to ‚ÄúPlease do not forget to add the files to the project!‚Äù and ‚ÄúDo not make up APIs!‚Äù. Yes, they label it an experiment, but I am sure it‚Äôs mandated use.

And why label it an experiment? The very same engineers just went on stage and told us, how it improves their workflow! Why am I not witnessing any use of Copilot in other PRs? What am I missing here?

Of course there‚Äôs a chance I am getting the whole thing wrong and Microsoft engineers believe in this? Or am I witnessing a cult? Whatever it is, outside the distortion bubble this whole thing looks pretty bad.

## 2025-06-07: Fulltext Search Engine using SQLite and FTS5 Tables ##

I've started a new job in 2024, so my free-time budget for writing blog articles took a cut.

One of the projects I didn't write about is a Full-Text Search Engine using SQLite FTS5 and Blazor WASM:

* [https://github.com/bytefish/SqliteFulltextSearch](https://github.com/bytefish/SqliteFulltextSearch)

## 2025-06-07: Another "Google Zanzibar" Experiment with .NET ##

Relationship-based Access Control is an interesting approach to Authorization, with "Google Zanzibar" as an 
implementation described by Google. It's kind of a nemesis for me, because I have already tried to:

* Build something with OpenFGA, which is a Google Zanzibar implementation (Failed)
* Build a ANTLR4 Parser for the Google Zanzibar Configuration Language (Success, but not useful)
* Implement the Check and Expand API described in the Google Zanzibar paper (Maybe Success)

So of course I am now exploring it again and try to implement the Check API, Expand API and ListObjects API:

* [https://github.com/bytefish/GoogleZanzibarExperiments](https://github.com/bytefish/GoogleZanzibarExperiments)

I don't know yet, if this is going to be successful or where it is going.

## 2025-06-07: Notes or "Lowering the Bar for Writing" ##

This "notes page" is an idea, to make it easier for me to *write*, without the tedious work of long-form blog articles. Maybe notes on this page are something akin to a small tweet.

At the moment this is a single page with technical and non-technical content being mixed wildly. I am not sure, if it‚Äôs a good idea. We will see.

However it lowers the bar for writing and publishing by a lot and I am sure I‚Äôll find a way to turn this into a more coherent piece.

As of now, I really like this format! üöÄ
