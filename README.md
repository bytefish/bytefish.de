[https://www.bytefish.de](https://www.bytefish.de) is generated by [Pelican](http://getpelican.com). 

You can install ``Pelican`` by using ``pip``:

```sh
pip install pelican
```

Depending on your Python installation, you might need to install the following packages to generate the pages:

```
pip install markdown
pip install BeautifulSoup4
```

To build the pages, simply run the following command from the root folder:

```
pelican -s settings/settings_dev.py .
```

The output will be written to the folder ``settings/output/DEV``.
