summary: A Python script to align faces geometrically.

Some people have asked me how I've aligned the face images in my articles. Giving people my ImageMagick hack is embarrassing for me, so I've decided to rewrite it into a Python script. You don't need to copy and paste it, as the script comes with the source folder of my [Guide on Face Recognition](https://bytefish.de/blog/face_recognition_with_opencv2): [crop_face.py](https://github.com/bytefish/facerecognition_guide/blob/master/src/py/crop_face.py).

The code is really easy to use. To scale, rotate and crop the face image you just need to call ``CropFace(image, eye_left, eye_right, offset_pct, dest_sz)``, where:

* ``eye_left`` is the position of the left eye
* ``eye_right`` is the position of the right eye
* ``offset_pct`` is the percent of the image you want to keep next to the eyes (horizontal, vertical direction)
* ``dest_sz`` is the size of the output image

If you are using the same ``offset_pct`` and ``dest_sz`` for your images, they are all aligned at the eyes.

## example ##

Imagine we are given [this photo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Arnold_Schwarzenegger_edit%28ws%29.jpg) of Arnold Schwarzenegger, which is under a Public Domain license. The ``(x,y)``-position of the eyes are approximately ``(252,364)`` for the left and ``(420,366)`` for the right eye. Now you only need to define the horizontal offset, vertical offset and the size your scaled, rotated & cropped face should have. Here are some examples:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Configuration</th>
      <th>Cropped, Scaled, Rotated Face</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>0.1 (10%), 0.1 (10%), (200,200)</td><td><img src="/static/images/blog/aligning_face_images/arnie_10_10_200_200.jpg" alt="configuration" /></td></tr>
    <tr><td>0.2 (20%), 0.2 (20%), (200,200)</td><td><img src="/static/images/blog/aligning_face_images/arnie_20_20_200_200.jpg" alt="configuration" /></td></tr>
    <tr><td>0.3 (30%), 0.3 (30%), (200,200)</td><td><img src="/static/images/blog/aligning_face_images/arnie_30_30_200_200.jpg" alt="configuration" /></td></tr>
    <tr><td>0.2 (20%), 0.2 (20%), (70,70)  </td><td><img src="/static/images/blog/aligning_face_images/arnie_20_20_70_70.jpg" alt="configuration" /></td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
