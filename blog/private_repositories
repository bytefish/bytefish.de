summary: An update message. 

A few days ago I’ve deleted this page and deleted all domains I’ve owned. No worries, I am fine. 👍

The traffic to this site has gradually decreased due to LLMs. Google is now de-ranking the page, because according to its Search Console it’s not “fresh content”. And on top you are crawled to death by thousands of AI startups.

So who am I writing all this for?

Most of my repositories however have now been switched into private mode. And if you need access to any of the repositories here, then just let me know.

My mail address is philipp@bytefish.de, the Issue Tracker on this page’s GitHub repository has been deactivated.
