summary: Dropping Disqus and using GitHub for discussions on articles.

Disqus is a great service and I noticed visitors are trusting it and comment a lot. I am sure it brought quite some 
traffic to my page and made it a lot more interactive. Disqus is a company, that needs to make money, so they started 
to show ads lately.  

I am not switching to a priced, ad-free plan and I don't want my visitors to see ads, so I decided to drop Disqus from my pages.

Every page now contains a "How To Contribute" section, which explains how to ask questions or give feedback on articles. 

This is possible, because this page is a GitHub repository at:

* <a href="https://github.com/bytefish/bytefish.de">https://github.com/bytefish/bytefish.de</a>

You can use the GitHub issue page for general discussions and feedback on articles. At the moment I have no intentions 
to automate the process or automatically include the discussions on the pages. If it all turns out to be too messy, I 
will start implementing a better solution.
