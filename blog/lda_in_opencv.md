summary: A project for Linear Discriminant Analysis in OpenCV.

There was a question on [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) on:

* [How to calculate the Fisherfaces with OpenCV](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7574623/c-face-detection-recognition-implementations). 

So I wrote a class to perform a Linear Discriminant Analysis with OpenCV, which is available at:
