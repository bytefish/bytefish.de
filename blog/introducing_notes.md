summary: This post is an introduction for the notes page.

I have recently started a “notes” page, that allows me to write more free-form, instead of long-form articles in a blog:

* [https://www.bytefish.de/notes.html](https://www.bytefish.de/notes.html)

On the “notes” page I am going to share ideas and maybe anecdotal stuff, and I a want to share how side-project ideas keep on working in my head.

If you are a programmer with a full-time job and a family, it’s somewhat hard to balance a desire for side-projects and family time.

Family always wins.
