## Growing Software and Getting Things off the Ground ##

In the notes page you can see, how "flink-jam" went from a small project idea 
to an implementation. This is how most of my projects are built and how I work 
professionally:

* [https://www.bytefish.de/notes.html](https://www.bytefish.de/notes.html)

My process is roughly this:

Gather sample data. Model the problem in code. Start to build a prototype. Validate 
the plan. Concentrate on the 95% use cases and label the missing 5% to be manually 
done by the user. Then extract common logic. Write tutorials on it. Get the people  
on board.

You have to understand, that my approach to products, projects and programming is 
to first create lots and lots of chaos, then iterate on the chaos until things 
become less and less chaotic and then at a point? They start to fall into 
place.

This approach to Software development is often at odds with larger teams and 
it's at odds with agile development. SCRUM and other development methodologies 
require you to estimate all your tasks ahead.

But the thing is: I often don't know how to model the problem *yet*, I don't 
know my users and haven't internalized the domain yet. Thus I cannot estimate 
any of it reliably. 

At the moment I am trying to solve this issue by getting team members on board 
early on in the process and participate. But I've noticed, that it's often way 
too taxing for younger developers, because I move from *A* to *C* to *B* to *E* and 
back to *A* to understand how to build *D*.

What's your approach to getting things off the ground?
