summary: Starting a new job as a Software developer.

If you are looking at my GitHub Timeline, it's pretty easy to spot the moment 
I've started a new job. It's usually when commits very suddenly drop to a 
zero:

<div style="display:flex; align-items:center; justify-content:center;margin-bottom:15px;">
    <a href="/static/images/blog/starting_a_new_job/github_timeline.jpg">
        <img src="/static/images/blog/starting_a_new_job/github_timeline.jpg" alt="GitHub Timeline of 2024">
    </a>
</div>

I am alive and well!

Starting a new job is always an intense experience and overwhelming at times. 

You are getting to know the company, team, domain, processes, code, libraries and 
frameworks. And you are sitting by the campfire, with elderly developers passing 
on stories to the next generation.

    </a>
</div>

Now things settle down, the family has adapted to the rhythm and there's time. But at the 
moment I am in a situation, where code I am writing at work is somewhat closely related to 
my open source code.

I don't want to accidentally reuse code written for my employer. So maybe I'll try something 
new for these pages and write about other aspects of programming instead. It'll take some 
time to work it out.

It would be interesting to know, how other people handle this situation?
