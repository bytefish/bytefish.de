summary: Starting a new job as a Software developer.

If you are looking at my GitHub Timeline, it's pretty easy to spot the moment 
I've started a new job. It's usually when commits very suddenly drop to a 
zero:

<div style="display:flex; align-items:center; justify-content:center;margin-bottom:15px;">
    <a href="/static/images/blog/starting_a_new_job/github_timeline.jpg">
        <img src="/static/images/blog/starting_a_new_job/github_timeline.jpg" alt="GitHub Timeline of 2024">
    </a>
</div>

I am alive and well!

Starting a new job is always an intense experience and overwhelming at times. You are getting 
to know the company, team, domain, processes, code, libraries and frameworks. And you are 
sitting by the campfire, with elderly developers passing on stories to the next generation.

Now things settle down, the family has adapted to the rhythm and there's time. But at the 
moment I am in a situation, where code I am writing at work is somewhat closely related to 
my open source code.

It's high-risk to accidentally reuse code written for my employer, thus risking my job. So 
maybe I'll try something new for these pages and write about some other aspects of 
programming. I have some ideas, but it'll take time to work it out.

It would be interesting to know, how other people handle this situation?
