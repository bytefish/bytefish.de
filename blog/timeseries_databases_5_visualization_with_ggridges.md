summary: This part shows how to generate Ridgeline plots with R.

In [Part 4] of my series on Timeseries databases I have shown how to read the time series data with [R]. You have 
seen how to create choropleth maps using open data [Shapefiles]. 

Now choropleth maps are an excellent tool to show changes over space, but we are not able to visualize 
subtle changes in distributions over time. So while I was browsing for interesting ways to visualize time 
series data I found [Ridgeline plots].

According to the [ggridges] documentation;

> Ridgeline plots are partially overlapping line plots that create the impression of a mountain range. They can be quite 
> useful for visualizing changes in distributions over time or space.

[R] provides a great package [ggridges] written by [Claus Wilke].

## The Plan ##

In [Part 1] of the series I have shown how to parse weather data for Germany provided by the [Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD)]. 

In this post I want to use [Postgres] with [TimescaleDB] to efficiently query and aggregate the DWD weather data. Then 
I will use the [ggridges] library to display the temperature distribution in 2017 of a weather station. 

### The DWD Dataset ###

The [DWD Open Data] portal of the [Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD)] gives access to the historical weather data in Germany. 

I decided to use all available historical air temperature data for Germany given in a 10 minute resolution ([FTP Link]). 

## SQL Query ##

It starts with getting the data from [Postgres]. For R scripts I always put SQL queries in a separate file to keep the R script 
clean from SQL statements. The query groups the weather data by *station*, *day*, *month* and aggregates by *air temperature*. 

[RPostgres] only allows binding positional parameters, so always make sure to pass the parameters in correct order:

```sql
SELECT s.identifier as "station", date_trunc('day', w.timestamp) "day",  date_part('month', w.timestamp) "month_idx", to_char(w.timestamp, 'Month') "month",  avg(w.air_temperature_at_2m) "avg_temp"
FROM sample.weather_data w
    INNER JOIN sample.station s ON w.station_identifier = s.identifier
WHERE s.identifier = $1 AND w.timestamp >= $2 AND w.timestamp < $3
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3, 4
ORDER BY 1, 2, 3
```

## R Script ##

The [R] script uses the SQL Query to get the data and then preprocess the data, such as cleaning the data from SQL and 
reordering the factors. Then I am using the example plot from the [ggridges] documentation:

#install.packages("ggridges")

library(DBI)
library(ggplot2)
library(viridis)
library(readr)
library(ggridges)

# Connect to the database:
connection <- dbConnect(RPostgres::Postgres(),
                 dbname = 'sampledb', 
                 host = 'localhost', # i.e. 'ec2-54-83-201-96.compute-1.amazonaws.com'
                 port = 5432, # or any other port specified by your DBA
                 user = 'philipp',
                 password = 'test_pwd')

# Read the SQL Query from an external file. Keeps the Script clean:
query <- read_file("D:\\github\\GermanWeatherDataExample\\GermanWeatherData\\TimescaleDB\\R\\ggridges\\query.sql")

# Query the Database and bind the positional query parameters: 
temperatures <- dbGetQuery(connection, query, param = list('01766', '2017-01-01', '2018-01-01'))

# As a good citizen close RPostgres connection:
dbDisconnect(connection)

# First we trim off any whitespaces added by RPostgres, and then turn the characters 
# into Factors. The Factors will be unordered, so we order the factors by month. I am 
# adjusting it to be reverse, so it looks good in ggridges:
temperatures$month <- trimws(temperatures$month)
temperatures$month <- as.factor(temperatures$month)
temperatures$month <- factor(temperatures$month, levels = c("December", "November", "October", "September", "August", "July", "June", "May", "April","March", "February", "January"))

# Create the ggridges plot. This uses the same approach like described in the ggridges 
# documentation at: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggridges/vignettes/introduction.html.
# 
# I have used Station 01766, which is M端nster/Osnabr端ck, which I am hardcoding here:
ggplot(temperatures, aes(x = `avg_temp`, y = `month`, fill = ..x..)) +
  geom_density_ridges_gradient(scale = 3, rel_min_height = 0.01) +
  scale_fill_viridis(name = "avg_temp", option = "C") +
  labs(title = 'Temperatures M端nster/Osnabr端ck in 2017')
```

## Result ##

And the result shows the temperature distribution per months:

<div style="display:flex; align-items:center; justify-content:center;">
    <a href="/static/images/blog/timeseries_databases_5_visualization_with_ggridges/result.png">
        <img src="/static/images/blog/timeseries_databases_5_visualization_with_ggridges/result.png" alt="Final Rideline plot for Temperature distribution per months">
    </a>
</div>

## Conclusion ##

This was a short post again! 

I hope this articles gives a good start for using [ggridges] to display time series data in [Postgres].
